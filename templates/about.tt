  <h4>History</h4>
  <p>
    The long-running
    <a href="https://nethackwiki.com/wiki//dev/null/nethack_tournament">
      /dev/null/nethack tournament
    </a>
    was unexpectedly shut down in September 2017. When this was announced, some
    players from TeamSplat banded together quickly with the help of the
    hardfought.org server to put together a tribute tournament, which was
    intended to be the same as devnull but updated to 3.6.0.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tribute tournament was never planned to run for a second year;
    instead, respecting devnull's wishes to shut down completely and not keep
    its name going, plans for a new tournament were laid. This new tournament
    would be based off the newly available development version of NetHack, and
    would remain a primarily vanilla-like tournament, unlike other tournaments
    like <a href="https://junethack.net">Junethack</a> which focus on variant
    play.  It was also decided to keep the tradition of running the tournament
    throughout November, when a lot of veteran players come out of the woodwork
    checking to see if there's a tournament.
  </p>

  <h4>So TNNT is devnull?</h4>
  <p>
    TNNT is <i>not</i> devnull. As per krystal's wishes, the devnull name,
    tournament structure, and game changes have been retired. TNNT is a fresh
    start - any game changes are based on a clean vanilla nethack codebase, and
    the various components of the tournament were designed from scratch.
  </p>

  <h4>What about the devnull challenges?</h4>
  <p>
    As with the rest of devnull, the challenges have been permanently retired
    and are not implemented in TNNT. However, TNNT does add some of its own
    gameplay content, including features that don't exist in any variants. It's
    a bit of a work in progress. We plan to keep adding a bit of new content
    every year.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are looking for the code powering the devnull challenges, to use as
    a patch for your own purposes, you can find it... somewhere (we don't have
    a link handy).
